# jellyfin-tui

The goal of this project is a CMUS-like streaming client for Jellyfin with a featureful TUI.

The player has a cover image in the corner, courtesy of the [ratatui-image](https://github.com/benjajaja/ratatui-image) crate. Most modern terminals should support sixel graphics or equivalent.

### Features
- streams your music from Jellyfin
- global/local search
- last.fm scrobbling
- vim keybindings
- sixel cover image
- lyrics (from jellyfin 10.9)
- MPRIS controls
- simple queue

### Planned features
- playlists (play/create/edit)
- jellyfin-wide remote control
- transcoding
- offline caching
- dashboard tab (recently played, new music etc.)
- advanced queue with order control, shuffle, etc.

### Installation
Jellyfin-tui uses libmpv as the backend for audio playback. You need to have mpv installed on your system.

#### Linux
Linux is the main target OS for this project. You can install mpv from your package manager.
```bash
# add ~/.cargo/bin to your PATH (~/.bashrc etc.) if you haven't already
export PATH=$PATH:~/.cargo/bin/

# install mpv
sudo pacman -S mpv # arch
sudo apt install mpv libmpv-dev # ubuntu

# clone and run
git clone https://github.com/dhonus/jellyfin-tui
cd jellyfin-tui
cargo run --release

# or install
cargo install --path .
```

#### macOS
```bash
brew install mpv
git clone https://github.com/dhonus/jellyfin-tui
cd jellyfin-tui
export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:$(brew --prefix)/lib"
export PATH=$PATH:~/.cargo/bin/
cargo install --path .
```

### Configuration
When you run jellyfin-tui for the first time, it will ask you for the server address, username and password and save them in the configuration file.

The program **prints the config location** when run. On linux, the configuration file is located at `~/.config/jellyfin-tui/config.yaml`. Feel free to edit it manually if needed.
```yaml
# must contain protocol and port
server: "http://localhost:8096"
password: "password"
username: "username"
```

### Key bindings
|key|alt|action|
|---|---|---|
|space||play / pause|
|enter||select|
|up / down|k / j|navigate **up** / **down**|
|a/A||skip to next/previous album|
|tab|h / l|cycle between **Artist** & **Track** lists|
|shift + tab|h / l|cycle further to **Lyrics** & **Queue**|
|F1, F2||switch tab >>Â F1 - **Library**, F2 - **Search**|
|F1|ESC|return to **Library** tab|
|left / right|r / s|seek +/- 5s|
|n||next track|
|N||previous track; if over, 5s plays current track from the start|
|+ -||volume up / down|
|q|^C|quit|

### MPRIS
Jellyfin-tui registers itself as an MPRIS client, so you can control it with any MPRIS controller. For example, `playerctl`. Currently, it only supports play / pause, next and previous on linux. **Work is needed here**.

### Search

In the Artists and Tracks lists you can search by pressing '/' and typing your query. The search is case insensitive and will filter the results as you type. Pressing `ESC` will clear the search and keep the current item selected.

You can search globally by pressing `F2`. The search is case insensitive and will search for artists, albums and tracks. It will pull **everything** without pagination, so it may take a while to load if you have a large library. This was done because jellyfin won't allow me to search for tracks without an artist or album assigned, which this client doesn't support.
